# Sales-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(EDA)

Overview
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across different product categories and regions using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, spans sales data from 2023 to early 2024. I explored trends in product performance, regional sales, customer behavior, the impact of discounts, and more.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
Matplotlib (Data visualization)
Seaborn (Statistical data visualization)
Analysis and Visualizations
The analysis involved multiple steps, including cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data. The following approaches were used:

1. Data Cleaning & Exploration
Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers. The dataset was already clean and ready for analysis.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key features, patterns, and distributions within the data.
2. Key Visualizations
Bar charts to compare total sales across regions and product categories.
Box plots to visualize the distribution and identify outliers in sales across product categories.
Scatter plots to examine the relationship between discount percentages and sales volumes.
Line graphs to track the performance of product categories over time.
Heatmaps to analyze correlations between sales performance, product categories, and regions.
3. In-Depth Insights
Regional Performance: Breakdown of sales by region, identifying top-performing regions and underperforming ones.
Product Performance: Analyzed sales trends for individual product categories like Clothing, Electronics, Furniture, and Food.
Sales by Region & Product: Detailed analysis of how each product performed across different regions.
Customer Behavior: Studied new vs. returning customer sales patterns and their response to seasonal promotions and discounts.
Discount Impact: Explored the effect of different discount ranges on sales, identifying key discount brackets that maximized sales.
4. Correlation Analysis
Analyzed correlations between sales performance and product categories using heatmaps to uncover hidden patterns.
Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of sales performance, with a focus on product and region breakdowns, customer behavior, and the impact of discounts. By leveraging Python-based data analysis tools, I was able to generate actionable insights that could help businesses optimize sales strategies. The comprehensive use of visualizations such as box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps enabled a deep understanding of trends and relationships in the dataset.
